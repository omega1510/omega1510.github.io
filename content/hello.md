I am Hayaan. You can find out more about me [here](https://hayaan.me/now/).

**This is how you can get in touch:**

- This [blog](https://hayaan.me/) is the the only place on the internet where I post content. If it's somewhere else, it didn't come from me!

- My [email](mailto:hayaanrizvi@gmail.com) is the best way to get in touch with me. I'll try and reply quickly, but delays are to be expected.

- I don't post my phone number anywhere. If that's how you want to chat, send me an email and I'm sure we can work something out.

- I don't have any social media except for YouTube and LinkedIn. That's right; no Twitter, Instagram, Mastodon, etc.

- If you want to make a correction about something on this blog, [make a pull request](https://github.com/omega1510/omega1510.github.io).
